Checking each admission form manually is a big task and hence most institutes issue OMR admission forms to the students. The advantage of this type of admission form is that it becomes a soft copy automatically when it is scanned. With a good OMR software and a normal scanner, it is possible to evaluate huge numbers of admission forms easily.\\nInstructions to Fill OMR Admission\\nForm\\nThe admission form asks for more\\ndetailed information.

It would be best to practise on these photocopies first. This would prevent the occurrence of unnecessary errors on the original form.\\n\\uf0ae\\nRemember that a tampered OMR\\nadmission form cannot be scanned properly. Ensure that it is not folded.\\n\\uf0ae\\nAlways use a black or blue ballpoint\\npen for filling the form. Most institutes specify the colour of the pen to be used on the form.\\n\\uf0ae\\nNever use a stapler on the form. If you\\nhave to attach your photograph on the form, always do it with glue.\\n\\uf0ae\\nThe circles that you have to fill should\\nbe completely shaded.

The syllable which is pronounced the loudest is called the stressed syllable.\\nUnlike Indian languages where all\\nsyllables are pronounced with equal degree of loudness, in English only one syllable in a word is stressed. The other syllables are pronounced less louder than the stressed syllable, some may not be heard at all.

Even though the minister of finance repeatedly warned the king and queen against wasting money, they continued to spend great fortunes on their personal pleasure. This lavish spending greatly enraged the people of France. They felt that the royal couple bought its luxurious lifestyle at the poor people’s expense.\\nMarie Antoinette, the beautiful but\\nexceedingly impractical queen, seemed uncaring about her subjects’ misery.

She also surrounded herself with artists , writers, and musicians, who encouraged the queen to spend money even more profusely.\\nWhile the queen’s favourite glutted\\nthemselves on huge feasts at the royal table many people in France were starving. The French government taxed the citizens outrageously. These high taxes paid for the entertainments the queen and her court so enjoyed. When the minister of finance tried to stop these royal spendthrifts, the queen replaced him.  The intense hatred that the people felt for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette kept building until it led to the French Revolution. During this time of struggle and violence (1789 – 1799 ), thousands of aristocrats, as well as the king and queen themselves  lost their lives at the guillotine. Perhaps if Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had reined in their extravagant spending, the events that rocked France would not have occurred.\\n1.

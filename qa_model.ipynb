The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate.

Gemma Whelan appeared as his sister, Yara Greyjoy.

Their father Balon Greyjoy was played by Patrick Malahide. Many of the characters involved in the Greyjoys\\' storyline weren\\'t introduced, most notably Balon\\'s brother Aeron Greyjoy.

She subsequently appeared in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998) and ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000).  Daenerys was one of a few prominent characters not included in 2005's ''A Feast for Crows'', but returned in the next novel ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).\\n\\nIn the story, Daenerys is a young woman in her early teens living in Essos.

In reality, his biological father is his mother\\'s twin brother, Jaime Lannister.  He has a younger sister, Myrcella, and a younger brother, Tommen, both of whom are also products of Jaime and Cersei\\'s incestuous relationship.  Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.\\n\\nJoffrey is an amoral sadist who disguises his cruelty with a thin veneer of charm.  This is best epitomized by his response when his (then) betrothed offends him: Joffrey pronounces that his mother had taught him never to strike a woman, and so commissions a knight of the Kingsguard to hit her instead.  He enjoys forcing people to fight to the death, and enforces cruel punishments for lesser crimes.  He has no sense of personal responsibility, blaming failures on others.

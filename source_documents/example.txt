www.tntextbooks.inPreface
The overall aim of Communicative English for Class XII is to develop the 
communicative competence of learners as opposed to linguistic competence. 
Hence authentic materials have been given priority in this textbook as was done in Class XI. These materials will influence the quality of classroom interaction and language use. They include extracts from media, magazines, journals or books etc. The textbook has been prepared keeping in mind the consistent needs and interests of the learners and in tune with the social and cultural context in which they will be used. The focus is to equip the learners with essential language skills and give them confidence to use them effectively in real-life situations. The materials are sensitive to perspectives of equality (gender and societal) and harmony (between humans, and between humans and nature), given that a quantum of independent reading is expected.
Emphasis is on study skills such as note-making, note-taking and reference 
skills and spoken and written communication skills such as public speaking, interviewing, and debating, rather than on writing essays on well-worn topics. Exposure to well-known speeches and the structure of arguments has been analysed. Grammar serves as a tool for increasing the language repertoire and for understanding the construction of text - rhetoric and argumentation.
ICT corner will kindle the learner’s interest to go beyond the textbook. 
This corner is a digital resource with adequate learning material. The additional information and reference skill will equip the learners to achieve effective learning and project completion.
Finally evaluation must be ‘proficiency’ rather than ‘achievement’ oriented, 
i.e. designed not to test the mastery of studied passages, but rather the ability to use the language appropriately in new contexts. 
The syllabus has been prepared according to the recommendations of the 
National Curriculum Framework 2005.

www.tntextbooks.inPage 3 Communicative English Page 2 In Harmony With The Worlda. Read the following passage.
“There’s always room for a story that can
transport people to another place. ”
- J.K.Rowling
Short stories capture human values 
evolving from wide ranging incidents and 
episodes. Each of the stories given below has a specific goal; to teach unique values that are truly valuable in life.
Positive Thinking
This parable  is told of a farmer who 
owned an old mule. The mule fell into the 
farmer’s well. The farmer heard the mule praying or whatever mules do when they fall into wells.
After carefully assessing the 
situation, the farmer sympathized with the mule, but decided that neither the mule nor the well was worth the trouble of saving. Instead, he called his neighbours together, told them what had happened, and enlisted them to help haul  dirt to 
bury the old mule in the well and put him out of his misery.
Initially the old mule was hysterical ! 
But as the farmer and his neighbours continued shovelling and the dirt hit his back, a thought struck him. It suddenly dawned on him that every time a shovel load of dirt landed on his back, HE WOULD SHAKE IT OFF AND STEP UP!
This he did, blow after blow. “Shake 
it off and step up… shake it off and step up… shake it off and step up!” He 
Readingrepeated to encourage himself. No matter how painful the blows, or how distressing  
the situation seemed, the old mule fought panic and just kept right on SHAKING IT OFF AND STEPPING UP!
It wasn’t long before the old 
mule, battered  and exhausted, stepped 
triumphantly over the wall of that well! What seemed like it would bury him actually helped him … all because of the manner in which he handled his adversity.
THAT’S LIFE! If we face our 
problems and respond to them positively, and refuse to give in to panic, bitterness, or self-pity, life becomes meaningful.
Selflessness
Once upon a time, there lived a big 
mango tree. A little boy loved to come and 
play around it every day.
He climbed to the tree top, ate the 
mangoes, and took a nap under the shade. He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him.
Time went by… The little boy grew, 
and he no longer played around the tree.
One day, the boy came back to the 
tree with a sad look on his face.
“Come and play with me, ” the tree 
asked the boy.
“I am no longer a kid; I don’t play 
around trees anymore. ” The boy replied, “I want toys. I need money to buy them. ”
“Sorry, I don’t have money, but you 
can pick all my mangoes and sell them so you will have money. ”
12th Communicative English Book.indb   2 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 3 Communicative English Page 2 In Harmony With The WorldThe boy was so excited. He picked all 
the mangoes on the tree and left happily. 
The boy didn’t come back. The tree was sad.
One day, the boy, now a grown man, 
returned. The tree was so excited.
“Come and play with me, ” the tree said.
“I don’t have time to play. I have to 
work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?”
“Sorry, I don’t have a house, but you 
can chop off my branches to build your h o u s e .”
So the man cut all the branches off 
the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the man didn’t return afterwards. The tree was again lonely and sad.
One hot summer day, the man 
returned and the tree was delighted.
“Come and play with me!” the tree 
said.
“I am sad and getting old. I want to 
go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?”
“Use my trunk to build your boat. 
Y ou can sail far away and be happy. ”
So the man cut the tree trunk to 
make a boat. He went sailing and didn’t return for a long time.
Finally, the man returned after he 
had been gone for many years.“Sorry, my boy, but I don’t have 
anything for you anymore. No more mangoes to give you. ” the tree said.
“I don’t have teeth to bite, ” the man 
replied.
“No more trunk for you to climb on. ”
“I am too old for that now, ” the man 
said.
“I really can’t give you anything− the 
only thing left is my dying roots, ” the tree 
said with sadness.
“I don’t need much now, just a place 
to rest. I am tired after all these years, ” the man replied.
“Good! Old tree roots are the best 
place to lean on and rest. Come sit down with me and rest. ”
The man sat down and the tree was 
glad and smiled.
The tree in the story represents our 
parents. When we are young, we love to play with them. When we grow up, we leave them and only return when we need help. Parents sacrifice everything for us, like the tree.
All experiences teach us something. 
A valuable lesson can be learnt from these stories. The short story then can be equated with situations in life and values can be established, which in turn motivate us. The moral and ethical principles imparted through these short stories help in influencing behaviour and priorities in life.

Be A Friend
- By Edgar Albert Guest
Be a friend. Y ou don’t need money;
Just a disposition sunny;
Just the wish to help another
Get along some way or other; 
Just a kindly hand extended
Out to one who’s unbefriended;
12th Communicative English Book.indb   4 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 5 Communicative English Page 4 In Harmony With Th  e World
Just the will to give or lend, 
This will make you someone’s friend.
Be a friend. Y ou don’t need glory.
Friendship is a simple story.
Pass by trifling errors blindly,
Gaze on honest effort kindly,
Cheer the youth, who’s bravely trying,
Pity him who’s sadly sighing;   
Just a little labour spend
On the duties of a friend.
Be a friend. The pay is bigger
(Though not written by a figure)
That is earned by people clever
In what’s merely self-endeavour.
Y ou’ll have friends instead of neighbours
For the profits of your labours;
Y ou’ll be richer in the end
Than a prince, if you’re a friend.
e.  Complete the summary of the poem given below with suitable words.
In the first stanza, the poet explains that it doesn’t cost any ..................... to be a

without equal participation of women and men in all spheres of life and at all levels. Being able to do more than one thing 
at a time is not easy. Women have however been able to multitask without much of a struggle, juggling between motherhood and career. 
Many a time we are stuck in tedious 
arguments. Some argue that a stay-at-home mother spends all her time with her child and shares a stronger bond, while the others believe that there is some truth in the adage “Distance makes the heart grow fonder. ”
Now with your partner/ group, analyse the 
pros and cons of stay-at-home mothers and working mothers and participate in a class debate organised by your teacher on the motion “Who makes a better home – a stay-at-home mother or a working mother?”

c. Notice that those who have English 
skills have an edge over others, when they attend an interview. 
a. Read the following passage carefully.
Frankness Matters
1. Whether in an exam, interview, or 
life itself, we may not always have answers 
to all questions. Right from when we begin school, through college, and even into the working world, we are coached 
 Readingto face questions with answers, to exhibit what we know, to fill the space between lines with words. When we encounter a question that we do not have an answer to, panic  sets in. We feel inadequate, or 
are prompted to immediately search for the answer - this latter response is mostly a good thing. But sometimes, we refuse to recognize or admit that we don’t know, and proceed to apply the most familiar of exam techniques- we fudge. Fudging can 
be a high art, and when done skilfully, can do a good job of persuading all but the most discerning examiner that you do 
know something. 
2. Don’t get me wrong here. I 
am certainly not advocating fudging, although it is something most of us have been guilty of doing, when we encounter the unexpected question or one that we just haven’t fully prepared for. In a written exam, it is possible to fudge and get away with, to some degree, but in a face-to-face situation, or in an interview, I wouldn’t recommend it. In fact, it is good to get comfortable with the idea that we may not always have answers to all questions in an examination, interview, and life. There are also contexts where it is not expected that you have a ready answer for every question, where a bit of uncertainty is not just acceptable, but even welcome. 
Honesty matters
3. Take the typical interview. Y ou 
may have questions that test your subject 
knowledge, assess your attitude, and get a sense of your skills. In terms of subject knowledge, there are some things that everyone who has studied a given subject Now list out a few soft skills that you think are necessary for one to succeed. 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   15 02/02/19   5:09 PM

the above passage, answer each of the 
questions given below by choosing the most appropriate option.
1.  What happens when we do not know 
the answer to a question?
a. lethargy sets inb. panic sets inc. expectation rises
2.  Fudging in a written examination 
a.  impresses people.
b.  persuades the examiner that you 
know something.
c. improves your communication.
3.  What are you expected to know in terms 
of subject knowledge in an interview?
a. the complexities of a subject
b.  the basic theories and foundational 
concepts
c. to assess yourselfGlossary
panic (n) -sudden fear or 
anxiety
inadequate (adj.) -insufficient
fudge (n) -cover up
discerning (adj.) -judicious,  
enlightened
graciously (adv.) -pleasantly and kindly
faking (v) -pretending, falsify
extricate (v) -withdraw, free
humility (n) -humbleness
acknowledge (v) -accept, confess
strategy (n) -plan of actionis expected to know basic theories and 
foundational concepts. But every field of knowledge is vast and complex, and one cannot know everything; nor is someone at the entry level expected to. So while facing an interview, it is important to be aware of what you can speak of with confidence, and what you are not too comfortable talking about. When faced with questions from this second area, you should be able to graciously admit that 
you don’t know, or are not too sure.  
4. Fudging as an answer in an 
interview can be disastrous. For one, interviewees are usually experienced enough to be able to tell when a candidate is just shooting the breeze. For another, if you really don’t know the answer, you may get so involved in faking  knowledge 
that you end up spinning a complicated web that you can’t extricate yourself from. 
This may lead to follow-up questions that only make it worse. Instead, a simple “I’m afraid I don’t know” could save you and your interviewers considerable misery and embarrassment.
5. Being able to say that you don’t 
know requires confidence and humility. 
It is important to prepare well for any test, and to try to cover as much ground as possible, but it is equally important to acknowledge that it is impossible to 
know everything, particularly when there may be questions that combine theory, application and strategy . A sincere 
response that acknowledges the current limits of one’s knowledge yet indicates a willingness and interest to learn would go a long way in making a good impression.

THE BUILDERSHENRY W ADSWORTH LONGFELLOW
All are architects of Fate,  
Working in these walls of Time;  
Some with massive deeds and great,  
Some with ornaments of rhyme.Nothing useless is, or low;  
Each thing in its place is best;  
And what seems but idle show  
Strengthens and supports the rest.
For the structure that we raise,  
Time is with materials filled;  
Our to-days and yesterdays  
Are the blocks with which we build.Truly shape and fashion these;  
Leave no yawning gaps between;  
Think not, because no man sees,  
Such things will remain unseen.In the elder days of Art,  
Builders wrought  with greatest care  
Each minute and unseen part;  
For the Gods see everywhere.Let us do our work as well,  
Both the unseen and the seen;  
Make the house, where Gods may dwell , 
Beautiful, entire, and clean.Else our lives are incomplete,  
Standing in these walls of Time,  
Broken stairways, where the feet  
Stumble as they seek to climb.Build to-day, then, strong and sure,  
With a firm and ample  base;  
And ascending and secure  
Shall to-morrow find its place.Thus alone can we attain  
To those turrets, where the eye  
Sees the world as one vast plain,  
And one boundless reach of sky.

of differences in their interests. While one was interested in books, 
the other was fond of travelling.
Interviewer  : Who introduced you to books?
Anil Sharma  :  During my early childhood, we were in Delhi. My father was very 
attached to me and spent a lot of time with me. He introduced me to books and films. I was only ten years old when he died. It was a traumatic experience and for two or three years I became  a recluse and books were my only companions.  
Interviewer
 : How did you do in your studies?
Anil Sharma  :  I loved to study English and History but hated Maths. I used to read 
a lot of books in the school library. Y ou could say I was self-taught.
Interviewer  :  Did it take long for your first novel, “The Flying Frog” to get 
published?
Anil Sharma  :  Y es ! A couple of years. On my mother’s suggestion I went to England 
when I was 17 and took up various jobs there. I would write when I came home in the evenings.

Anil Sharma  :  I missed my friends. I came back purely for emotional reasons.
Interviewer  :  Did it affect your writing career? 
Anil Sharma  :  I would write four or five short stories and articles every month and

FILLING IN FORMS
We learnt to fill in forms in  Class XI. 
Let us look at some more forms.
OPTICAL MARK RECOGNITION 
(OMR) FORMS
Every college or university has to 
deal with lots of admission forms every year. Checking each admission form manually is a big task and hence most institutes issue OMR admission forms to the students. The advantage of this type of admission form is that it becomes a soft copy automatically when it is scanned. With a good OMR software and a normal scanner, it is possible to evaluate huge numbers of admission forms easily.
Instructions to Fill OMR Admission 
Form
The admission form asks for more 
detailed information. Along with the 
name, date of birth and other such basic information, it also requires information like names of the students' parents, marks acquired by the student, etc. As this information would be recorded with the institute, it is important that mistakes are not made while filling the form. Therefore, it is essential to know about the rules of filling the OMR admission form.

  The students should take several 
photocopies of the admission form 
before filling up the actual form. It would be best to practise on these photocopies first. This would prevent the occurrence of unnecessary errors on the original form.

  Remember that a tampered OMR 
admission form cannot be scanned properly. Ensure that it is not folded. 

  Always use a black or blue ballpoint 
pen for filling the form. Most institutes specify the colour of the pen to be used on the form.

  Never use a stapler on the form. If you 
have to attach your photograph on the form, always do it with glue.

  The circles that you have to fill should 
be completely shaded. Light or half-filled circles would not be read by the scanner software.
The OMR admission form is a 
document that would help you to secure admission in a college or university. Hence, make sure that you fill the form carefully without making any errors.

Whose fault?
1. A 20 - year - old BCA student
met with an accident − his bike rammed  
a tractor p a

had iron rods 
sticking out. It was dark

the rods. The

child. The fami

where Arjun had been taken. Doctors told 
them that he was brain dead. Even though 
Readinghis heart was beating and he was breathing, 
he was in fact dead. The precious life of a young man was lost!
3. Why did this happen, even after
the government has banned vehicles from carrying rods, pipes or any protruding material beyond the body frame? The road transport ministry has deleted the provision in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules that allows protrusions  up to one 
meter.
4. The Supreme Court had sought
the centre’s response in this regard, because thousands of motorists die every year in accidents caused by  trucks parked recklessly on highways, many with iron rods protruding from their body frames. The Road Transport Ministry is trying its best to focus on the rule that the material Warm up

within the length of the vehicle or trailer. 
But truck drivers seldom  follow the law. 
They do not follow the practice of fixing blinkers at the end point of protruding material to warn vehicles coming from behind.
5. Arjun still lives in 34 lives
Arjun’s family  bravely put its grief 
behind and came forward to give the gift 
of life to others. They asked the doctors to harvest their son’s organs  - a decision that would help save at least 34 people.
6. Arjun’s heart valve, pancreas,
cornea and at least 20 other organs were preserved for transplant, said doctors at AIIMS Trauma Centre where the organ retrieval was conducted; matching recipients were identified and the transplants carried out simultaneously. 
7. Arjun’s family has set an example
and created an awareness about organ donation among  the family members of brain dead persons. Many families are unable to understand or accept what brain death means. A senior forensic expert says, “ Brain death means the irreversible loss of brain functions which has to be certified by a team of experts as per the law. Once a patient is declared brain dead, more than 37 different organs and tissues can  be harvested , including the heart, 
liver, lung, kidney and pancreas among others. ”
8. AIIMS has reported a threefold
increase in the number of such donations after Arjun’s gift of life to 34 people. Arjun is physically not alive today, but he continues to live in those who have received his organs. He has become a source of inspiration to many others who are coming forward to donate organs.
9. Experts say that more than 3000
patients die in India for want of organ donors. In India, there are just 0.08 organ donors per million people. The Director of Health Services, says a central body called National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) is being set up to increase the availability of organs from cadaver donors, build capacity for  organ retrieval and transplantation and roll out post transplant services to recipients and living donors.

The woman was old and ragged  and gray

And the woman’s feet were aged and slow.
She stood at the crossing and waited long, 
Alone, uncared for, amid the throng

Of human beings who passed her by 
Nor heeded  the glance of her anxious eyes.
Down the street, with laughter and shout, Glad in the freedom of “school let out, ”
Came the boys like a flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep.
Past the woman so old and gray 
Hastened the children on their way.
Nor offered a helping hand to her– 
So meek , so timid, afraid to stir
Lest  the carriage wheels or the horses’ feet 
Should crowd her down in the slippery street.
At last came one of the merry troop, 
The gayest laddie of all the group;
He paused beside her and whispered low, 
“I’ll help you cross, if you wish to go. ”
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm,
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were firm and strong.
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content.
“She’s somebody’s mother, boys, you know, 
For all she’s aged and poor and slow,
And I hope some fellow will lend a hand 
To help my mother, you understand,
If ever she’s poor and old and gray, 
When her own dear boy is far away. ”
And “somebody’s mother” bowed low her head 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said
Was “God be kind to the noble boy, 
Who is somebody’s son, and pride and joy!”ragged (adj.)-worn out

Act 1
William Shakespear e’s ‘As You Like It’ is 
set in France in the early 
1600s and 
follows 
the love story of Rosalind and Orlando. 
The action takes place at the court of Duke Frederick and in the nearby Forest of Arden. As the play opens, Orlando is quarreling with his older brother Oliver over his inheritance. He complains that Oliver has not given him a proper gentleman’s education after the death of their father. Oliver threatens Orlando, and Orlando grabs Oliver by the throat and defies his older brother before releasing him. After the fight, Oliver persuades the 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   51 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inCommunicative English Page 52wrestler Charles to injure Orlando in a 
wrestling match the next day. Meanwhile Frederick’s daughter Celia tries to cheer up her dear cousin Rosalind, who is depressed because her father, Duke Senior, has been banished by his usurping brother, Duke Frederick. 
Rosalind and Celia attend the 
wrestling match and they meet Orlando, who easily beats Charles despite the brute’s undefeated status. Orlando and Rosalind fall in love at first sight, and Rosalind gives him a necklace as a prize for winning. When Duke Frederick learns that Orlando’s father is his former enemy, he is displeased. Immediately thereafter, Orlando is warned by his servant Adam that his brother plans to kill him that night. Faced with no options, Orlando flees to the Forest of Arden, and loyal Adam accompanies him. Orlando is not the only one to displease Duke Frederick; Duke Frederick has become disenchanted with Rosalind, believing that she outshines his daughter Celia. He banishes Rosalind from court, and Celia decides to follow her into exile in Arden as she cannot bear to be parted from her dearest friend. The two adopt disguises, with Rosalind becoming the young man Ganymede and Celia pretending to be Aliena, a peasant girl. Touchstone  the fool goes with them. 
Act 2 
Duke Senior, Rosalind’s father, and 
his men have taken up residence in the Forest of Arden during his exile. Among them is the witty, philosophical Jacques, who enjoys being depressed and never misses an opportunity to bemoan his situation. The men hunt for deer and set up a picnic under a tree when Orlando bursts upon them with a sword. He is desperate for food for himself and Adam as the old man is weak from hunger and travel. Duke Senior graciously invites them both to join his party. 
Act 3 
Back at court Duke Frederick has 
discovered Celia missing, and he believes 
she and Rosalind have gone off with Orlando. He then takes Oliver’s lands into temporary custody and sends Oliver to find his brother with the hope of locating Celia. 
Orlando writes love poems to 
Rosalind and posts them on trees throughout the forest. In her disguise as Ganymede, Rosalind issues a witty challenge to Orlando. She claims she can cure him of his love if he will woo her as if she were Rosalind. He agrees to do so and promises to meet her later. At the same time, Touchstone has fallen in love with goat herder Audrey and tries to arrange a quick wedding, which Jacques talks him out of, in favour of a more official ceremony. As Rosalind and Celia wait for Orlando, they witness a spat between the young shepherd Silvius and shepherdess Phoebe, who scorns his love. Rosalind intervenes in as Ganymede, advising Phoebe to accept the young man, but instead Phoebe falls instantly for Ganymede. 
Act 4 
Orlando arrives late, and Ganymede 
scolds him for his tardiness, claiming 
there is no true love in him. Nonetheless, she allows him to woo her, and they agree to meet again later that day after Orlando 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   52 02/02/19   5:09 PM

Celebrations Of Expressionsattends on Duke Senior. This time while 
they wait, Silvius delivers to Ganymede a letter from Phoebe and is shocked to learn that it is a love letter. He departs, and Oliver arrives bearing a bloody handkerchief. He explains that Orlando has rescued him from a snake and a lion, and was wounded in the fray. The two, Oliver and Orlando, have been reconciled through Orlando’s brave act. Ganymede faints but quickly recovers from it and says it was merely playacting. 
Act 5 
Ganymede devises a plan to bring 
all the couples together to be married the 
next day. She promises to marry Phoebe if Phoebe will have her and extracts a promise from Phoebe that she will marry Silvius if she doesn’t marry Ganymede. 
Everyone gathers the next day, 
and Rosalind reveals her disguise as Ganymede. Her father, Duke Senior, gives her to Orlando to wed, and Phoebe agrees to marry Silvius as promised. Touchstone and Audrey will also be married, as will Celia and Oliver, who have fallen in love at first sight. The god of marriage, Hymen, performs the ceremony. Just then another brother of Oliver and Orlando arrives with the news that Duke Frederick has turned over a new leaf and returned his wealth, lands, and position to Duke Senior. The nobles resolve to return to court after the wedding celebration, but Jacques vows to follow Duke Frederick. The play ends with an epilogue in which Rosalind begs the favour of the audience in the form of applause for the actors.AS YOU LIKE IT (paraphrased) ACT - I
This play by William Shakespeare stands 
for all times; he is acclaimed for his opening scenes that exposes vividly the plot and introduces all the main characters sequentially and ties a knot which is untied in the subsequent acts and scenes.
Act I Scene 1
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
ORLANDO: I remember, Adam, that’s why my father only left me a thousand crowns in his will. And as you know, my father commanded my brother, Oliver, to make sure that I was brought up well—and that’s where my sadness begins. Oliver keeps my brother Jacques away at school, and everyone says he’s doing extremely well there. I ask you, is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am, to pen me in like an ox? His horses get treated better than I do—at least he feeds them and trains them properly, and spends a lot

me  plenty of nothing, and takes away everything else, letting me eat with his servants, refusing me what’s owed me as his brother, and ruining my good birth with a poor education. This is what angers me, Adam. My father’s temper and spirit, which I think I share, makes me want to mutiny against my brother’s tyranny. I won’ t stand for it any longer, though I haven’t yet figured out how to revolt.
(Enter Oliver)
ADAM: Here comes my master, your 
brother.
ORLANDO: Go hide, Adam, Y ou’ll hear 
how he abuses me.
OLIVER: Hey, you! What are you making 
here?
ORLANDO: Nothing. I’ve never been 
taught how to make anything.OLIVER: Well, then, what are you messing 
up?
ORLANDO: I’m helping you mess up one 
of God’s creations. Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
OLIVER: Do you know where you are, 
sir?
ORLANDO: Y es, sir, very well—I’m here 
in your orchard.OLIVER: Do you know whom you’re 
talking to?
ORLANDO: Y es, better than you know 
me. I know you’re my oldest brother and deserve more respect. But we’re in the same family, so you should acknowledge that I am a gentleman too. According to custom, as first-born you are my superior. But it’s not customary to treat me like I’m not even a gentleman.
OLIVER: ( hitting ORLANDO) What 
nerve!
ORLANDO: (grabbing hold of OLIVER ) 
Come on, big brother; you don’t know 
anything about fighting.
OLIVER: What, you dare put your hands 
on me, villain?ORLANDO: I’m no villain. I’m the 
youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, and 
anyone who claims my father’s sons is a villain himself.
ADAM: Gentlemen, calm down. For the 
sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
OLIVER: Let me, go, I say.
ORLANDO: I won’t until I’m ready. Y ou 
will listen to me. My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education. But you’ve raised me as a peasant, depriving

too, you old dog.ADAM: Is that my reward—to be called 
“old dog?” Well, it’s true, I’ve served this family so long I’ve gotten old and toothless, like a dog. God bless my old master. He would never have spoken to me like this.

Hood and his outlaws. 
OLIVER: So, are you going to wrestle 
before the new duke tomorrow?
CHARLES: Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come 
to let you in on a certain problem. I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose, that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise tomorrow. Sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed. Y our brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’ d hate to crush him—though I’ d have to, if he challenged me. 
OLIVER: Charles, I thank you for your 
loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward  you. I’ d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined. I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother. So use your discretion. I’ d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger. It brings me to tears to say this, but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked. Because he’s my brother, I have to take his side. 
CHARLES: I’m very glad I came to see 
you. If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what he deserves. If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again. Farewell, my lord.
OLIVER: Take care, Charles.(CHARLES exits.) (OLIVER continues.)Now it’s time to get this playboy brother 
of mine all worked up. I hope I’ll see the end of him soon—I don’t know why, but I hate nothing in the world as much as him, though he’s an upstanding guy. He’s never gone to school but he’s smart, with good values, and everyone is delighted by him and loves him, especially my subjects, who know him the best. They love him, and therefore they despise me.

ROSALIND: Y oung man, have you

ORLANDO: No, lovely princess. He is the 
general challenger. I have only come in— like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
CELIA: Y oung gentleman, you are too 
bold for your age. Y ou have seen the cruel  proof of this man’s strength. If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously. We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
ROSALIND: Please, young sir. We’ll make 
sure your reputation isn’t hurt; we’ll take it upon ourselves to argue with the duke that the wrestling match should be called off.

change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
ROSALIND: My father loved Sir Rowland 
as much as he loved his own soul, and 
the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion. If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight.
CELIA: Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him 
and encourage him. My  father’s rude and 
envious behaviour is like a knife through my heart. (to ORLANDO) Sir, you fought 
very well. If you live up to your potential

you to leave this place. Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done. The duke is temperamental. I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out.
ORLANDO: Thank you, sir. Now please 
tell me this: which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter?
LE BEAU: Neither one is his daughter, to 
judge from their good manners. But really, the smaller one is his daughter. The other is the daughter of the banished duke. Goodbye, sir. Later, in a better world than this, I’ d love to get to know you.

Further Reading 
Just to spice up! Here are some 
idioms used by William Shakespeare in 
his plays:
1.  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose 
chase , I am done, for thou hast more 
of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?” — Mercutio
This term didn’t originally refer to 
actual geese, but rather a type of horse 
race .
2. “ O, beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is 
the green-eyed monster, which doth 
mock the meat it feeds on. ” — Iago
Before Shakespeare, the colour green 
was most commonly associated with illness. Shakespeare turned the notion of being sick with jealousy into a metaphor that we still use today.
3. “ Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as 
snow,  thou shalt not escape calumny. 
Get thee to a nunnery, go. ” — Hamlet
“Lawn as white as driven snow. ”  — 
Autolycus
Though Shakespeare never actually 
used the full phrase “pure as driven snow, ” both parts of it appear in his work. For the record, this simile works best right after the snow falls, and not a few hours later when tires and footprints turn it into brown slush.
4. “True is it that we have seen better 
days  and have with holy bell been knolled 
to church, and sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendered. ” — Duke Senior
The first recorded use of “seen better 
days” actually appeared in Sir Thomas More’s work in 1590, but the play was written anonymously, and is often at least partially attributed to Shakespeare. We do know Shakespeare was a fan of the phrase; he uses “seen better days” in As Y ou Like It, and then again in Timon of Athens.
5. “This is a way to kill a wife with kindness, 
and thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong 
humor. ” — Petruchio. The Shakespeare canon would contain fewer dead bodies if his characters all believed they should kill their enemies with kindness instead of knives and poison.

c. THE BIRD SANCTUARY - Sarojini Naidu.In your quiet garden wakes a magic tumult
Of winged choristers that keep the Festival of Dawn,Blithely rise the carols in richly cadenced rapture,From lyric throats of amber, of ebony and fawn. 
The bulbul and the oriole, the honey-bird and shama
Flit among high boughs that drip with nectar and with dew,Upon the grass the wandering gull parades its sea-washed silver.The hoopoe and the kingfisher their bronze and sapphire blue.
Wild gray pigeons dreaming of a home amid the tree-tops,
Fill their beaks with silken down and slender banyan twigs.But the jade-green gipsy parrots are only gay marauders.And pause upon their sun-ward flight to plunder red ripe figs.
In your gracious garden there is joy and fostering freedom.
Nesting place and singing space for every feathered thing,O Master of the Birds, grant sanctuary and shelterAlso to a homing bird that bears a broken wing.

STRESS
Speaking is generally considered 
the hardest skill to master in English. This is because the English language has unique concepts called STRESS AND 
INTONATION, which is essential to communicate effectively.
Stress is the emphasis given to select 
sounds / syllables in words. This means, some sounds/syllables are pronounced louder than the others. The syllable which is pronounced the loudest is called the stressed syllable.
Unlike Indian languages where all 
syllables are pronounced with equal degree of loudness, in English only one syllable in a word is stressed. The other syllables are pronounced less louder than the stressed syllable, some may not be heard at all. This is why we do not follow the English spoken by native speakers. 
The stressed syllable in a word 
is constant. For example, heat , party, 
energy, mem ory, employee , philoso phical, 
administra tion.
In spoken language, grammatical 
or form words such as auxiliary verbs, prepositions, pronouns, articles etc., are generally not  stressed. Lexical or content words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, linkers  must have at least one stressed syllable.Note:  A SYLLABLE is a unit formed by 
a vowel with one or more consonants. Syllables combine to form words.
12th Communicative English Book.indb   76 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 77
Celebrations Of ExpressionsHowever, there is no rule to decide 
which syllable should be stressed in a 
polysyllabic word (word with more than one syllable). They have to be learnt consciously using a dictionary.
Lexical words (nouns, verbs, adjectives 
and adverbs) are stressed.
Grammatical words (auxiliaries, 
prepositions, pronouns, articles) do not receive any stress.
In words with weak suffixes, the root of 
the word is stressed.Compound Nouns take the stress on the 
first syllable.
Compound adjectives take the stress on 
the second syllable.
Compound Verbs take the stress on the 
second syllable. 
Inflectional words do not change their 
stress pattern even after the suffix is added.
Derivational words change from parts of 
speech to another and so their utterance varies and so does the stress.
Words ending with -ic, -sion, -tion are 
stressed on the penultimate syllable. 
(second from the end).
Words ending with -cy, -ty, -phy, -gy 
-al are stressed on the ante-penultimate 
syllable. (third from the end)
Syllable stress is usually indicated by 
a (')mark over the syllable, as is seen in dictionaries. In the above examples,  the spellings that represent the syllables are highlighted.In sentences, we stress only some 
words and pronounce them louder than the others. By emphasising on a particular word, we can add/ modify the meaning of the sentence. Note that the basic meaning of the sentence does not undergo any change. 
Look at the following example.I gave her an apple yesterday. 
See how the sentence gains in 
meaning by changing the stress from one 
word to another. 
I gave her an apple yesterday. (Only I gave, 
not somebody else)
I gave  her an apple yesterday. (gave, not 
bought)I gave her an apple yesterday. (her and not 
somebody else)I gave her an apple  yesterday. (apple not 
banana)I gave her an apple yesterday . (yesterday, 
not any other time)

about it. But as long  as you have  the 
chance to see them it’s good, right? Sara :  Fine. But we’re going to meet them  
next Friday . No excuses.
Babu : Sure , definitely.INTONATION
Intonation  is the way the pitch of a 
speaker's voice goes up or down as they 
speak.  Say this sentence: - “Hello” to the 
following people:
 a friend you meet often

  a friend you are meeting after a long 
time
 a neighbour who is troublesome
 a 6 month infant
  someone you are seeing for the first 
time
to know if someone is in the room
the same as above but on the phone
Is there a difference in the way you 
say ‘Hello’? Discuss and share your  views.
The difference is because you raise or 
lower your voice according to your attitude towards the person. This change in the pitch of your voice is called Intonation .
Types of Intonation
There are four types of Intonation: Falling, 
Rising, Fall-rise and Rise-fall.
They are denoted by the following signs:
Falling - \  Rising - /
Fall-Rise -v  Rise-Fal l - Ʌ

Celebrations Of ExpressionsFalling tone is the most common 
type of intonation in English. It is used for 
asking and giving information in a normal, quiet, style. Usually statements, that are categorical, confident and convincing, are expressed in this tone.

Falling tone is used on the last 
stressed syllable of the sentence inStatements(declarative sentences):

He doesn’t have the \book.
Questions: 
What do you\want?
Commands (imperative sentences):

 Would you like to have coffee or \
tea? 
Do you want a pen or a pen\cil?
Tag questions(When the answer is sure 
to be ‘yes’)
Y ou live here, don’t \you?
Rising intonation in English expresses a 
number of emotions such as : non-finality, surprise, doubt, politeness, interest, lack of confidence etc. Standard rising intonation in English usually goes down a little first and then rises up.
Rising intonation is used in

NOTE MAKING
Given below is a sample for note making.
MADHUBANI P AINTING
Madhubani painting is one of the 
many famous Indian art forms. As it is practised in the Mithila region of Bihar and Nepal, it is called Mithila or Madhubani art. Often characterized by complex geometrical patterns, these paintings are known for representing particular occasions, including festivals, religious rituals, etc. The colours used in Madhubani paintings are usually derived from plants and other natural sources. These colours are often bright and pigments like lampblack and ochre are used to create black and brown respectively. Instead of contemporary brushes, objects like twigs, matchsticks and even fingers are used to create the paintings.
Madhubani 
paintings originated in 
the Mithila region of Bihar. Some of the initial references to the Madhubani painting can be found in the Hindu epic Ramayana when King Janaka, Sita’s father, asks his painters to create Madhubani paintings for his daughter’s wedding. The knowledge was passed down from generation to generation and the paintings began to adorn the houses of the region. The women of the village practiced these paintings on the walls of their respective 
home. Their paintings often illustrated their thoughts, hopes and dreams. 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   86 02/02/19   5:09 PM

Celebrations Of ExpressionsOver time, Madhubani paintings 
became a part of festivities and special 
events like weddings. Slowly, this art attracted connoisseurs of art as many contemporary Indian artists took the art to the global stage. The traditional base of plastered mud wall was soon replaced by handmade paper, cloth and canvas. Since the paintings have been confined to a limited geographical range, the themes as well as the style are more or less the same.
Madhubani paintings were initially 
practised by different sects of people and hence the paintings were categorized into five different styles, such as Tantrik, Kohbar, Bharni, Godna, Katchni. But today, these five different styles have been merged by contemporary artists. The themes used in these paintings often revolve around Hindu deities like Krishna, Rama, Lakshmi, Shiva, Durga and Saraswati. Also, heavenly bodies like the Sun and the Moon often form the centerpiece of Madhubani paintin gs. The 
women of the village practised these paintings on the walls of their respective homes.
One can also find paintings based 
on the scenes from the royal courts and social events like weddings. The usage of geometrical patterns is apparent in these paintings. The fact that these complex mathematical patterns were used in Madhubani paintings makes them more intriguing and special.
These paintings are also known for 
their simplicity, for the brush and colours used are often derived from natural sources. While the paintings are largely made using powdered rice, colours are derived from turmeric, pollen, pigments, indigo, various flowers, sandalwood, and leaves of various plants and trees, etc. Also, many natural sources are combined and are processed to obtain the desired colours. The colours are often prepared by the artists themselves. If the artists come across empty spaces even after completing the painting, they usually fill up those empty spaces with the motifs of flowers, animals, birds and geometrical patterns. A double line is usually drawn as the border.

www.tntextbooks.inPage 95 Communicative English Page 94 Better Together1. One of the major problems today is food 
wastage. It is estimated that 30 percent of all the food produced around the world is lost, trashed or otherwise wasted every 
year. These statistics are staggering, 
especially when you consider how many people around the world need that food to survive.
2. A restaurant owner, Minu Pauline of 
Kochi, had a solution after seeing a hungry woman pick through trash one night. She decided to donate her restaurant’s left over food to the hungry. This initiative  
of hers soon became a major city-wide  
campaign. Pauline stored the café’s eats in a refrigerator outside her Kochi restaurant. 
4. We come across a lot of people who 
take part in community clean-up efforts. But not everyone has the drive to do what a young lawyer and environmentalist in Mumbai recently accomplished.
5. Afroj Shah was shocked by the pollution 
that he saw at Versova beach – rotting  
garbage. No one could walk along the 
beach, let alone swim in the water. He decided to protect the environment.
6. Initially Shah and his neighbour, an 
eighty-four-year-old man, would go out and pick as much trash as they could. After a while, Shah realised that he had to 
expand his team if he were to make a dent  
in what was essentially an environmental 
crisis. He began to knock on doors and talk to local residents, explaining the harm caused by marine pollution. His determination inspired a lot of people and soon dozens, hundreds and eventually more than a thousand volunteers from all walks of life pitched in. Clean-ups were ironically called “dates with the ocean” , because it was a Herculean task – cleaning the beach in the sweltering sun.
7. This massive undertaking by the 
Residents Volunteer Organisation is being hailed as the “World’s largest beach clean-up effort” . After months of toil they picked up tons of trash that had accumulated along the shoreline. They also cleaned fifty two public toilets and planted fifty 
coconut trees. For his vision and hard 
work, the UN awarded him the “Champion 
Beach clean up  Soon her small “left overs” refrigerator turned to a large scale donation centre with food from her kitchen and those of other restaurants nearby. Even other citizens donated food to this food bank as a way of helping out. It is open 24 hours a day and is never surveilled , allowing 
those in need to maintain their privacy  
while collecting donated food.
3. Best of all, the food bank provides food 
for dozens of locals every night, thereby cutting the food waste among the local restaurants. This has become the best example of civic sense and responsibility in recent times.

and feel that we owe a duty to our ocean to make it free of plastic, ” he told the UN, “I just hope this is the beginning for coastal communities across India and the world. ”
8. Shah’s work didn’t end with the last 
piece of trash picked up. He wanted to plant thousands of coconut trees and to 
return the beach to the lagoon as it once 
was. He continued to work to limit the garbage by building barriers  along the 
creek’s  upstream that  carried litter to the 
beach.

inspiring a nationwide awareness of environmentalism. Ultimately, Shah wants to export this mentality throughout the world, cleaning up oceans, and ecosystems to create a world that can foster life in all its splendour. Thus Afroj Shah and Minu Pauline proved to the world that individuals with great vision and mission can change the surroundings and make the world a better place to live in.

b. It is scientifically proved that solving 
detective riddles everyday will develop your reasoning skill. Now put on your thinking hat and solve the riddles  given below logically. 
1) A detective comes to a crime 
scene. A man is said to have jumped  out of a window of an abandoned building and committed suicide. The detective goes inside the building to the first floor, to the room at the front.   He goes up to the window through which the man had jumped, opens it and looks at the dead man. Then he goes to the second floor and does the same. He continues until he has visited all the floors and repeated the Chapter

action. Then he returns to his team and 
says that it’s by no means a suicide, but a murder. How did he find it out?  
2) Two young ladies stopped at a 
fresh fruit juice stall and ordered sweet lime juice with ice. One of them was very thirsty and drank very fast and ordered  one more. She had two glasses during the time, the other drank only one. Tragically the girl who was drinking the juice slowly dies while the other stayed alive. But it turned out that all the drinks they had been served contained poison. How is 
it possible that the girl who drank more survived ?Answers 
1) When a person commits suicide by jumping  out of a window, he doesn’t 
tend to close the window behind him. But in this case, none of the windows which faced the dead man  were left open. It means that the man wouldn’t have jumped out of the window. 
2) In fact, the poison was in the ice. The young lady who escaped death drank 
the juice before the ice cubes could melt completely. But the ice cubes in the other lady’s drink melted completely, releasing the poison into the juice.

a. Read the following story of how some young boys and their coach were saved from a cave in Thailand.
 Mission Impossible
1. On 23
rd June, 2018, 12−boys of a 
football team – ‘the Wild Boars’ went 
exploring in Thailand’s Chiang Rai province with their football coach and ended up being trapped for two weeks, deep inside a cave underneath a mountain.
2. What happened over those two weeks 
is a remarkable story of friendship, human endurance  and selflessness in saving lives. 
The dramatic rescue operation gripped the world.
 Reading3. The team and their young coach 
had often ventured  deep into Tham 
Luang cave, sometimes as far as 8 km for initiation rites where they would write the names of the new team members on a cave wall. 
4. In high spirits, they clambered  into 
the cave that fateful day with just their torches. After all, they were planning to be there only for an hour. They never thought that they would not emerge until two weeks later.
5. Deep in the cave, the Wild Boars 
found themselves in trouble. It had been raining for the last few days, and all the water falling on the mountain was fast filling up the Tham Luang cave system. The group was caught off guard by a flash flood. They had no choice but to scramble even deeper into the cave. 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   115 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 117 Communicative English Page 116 Mission Impossible6. The Wild Boars eventually found 
themselves marooned on a small rocky 
shelf about 4 km from the cave entrance, 
past a dry point known as Pattaya Beach which by now was flooded. Surrounded by darkness, the boys lost all sense of time. But they were determined to survive. They used rocks to dig deeper into the shelf to create a cavern  where they could huddle 
together and keep warm. Coach Aken, a former monk, taught the boys meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible and told them to lie still to conserve their strength. They had no food but they had water in the form of moisture dripping from the caves’ walls. They had the right conditions to survive at least for a little while. And most importantly the team had the support of each other.
7. Outside the 
cave, a full blown rescue operation was quickly unfolding. Th e 
Th ai Navy Seals, the 
National Police, other rescue teams and local volunteers pitched in.
8. Exploring the 
cave was a challenge. Weather was merciless and the heavy rainfall and flooding chambers hindered the rescuers. 
9.  Engineers desperately tried to pump 
water out of the cave – but struggled initially. 
10. At the start no one had any idea 
what to do. They even tried drilling into the mountain side and used drones with 
thermal sensors to locate the boys.
11.  Outside the cave, the boys’ worried 
families offered prayers for their lives. The group gradually expanded to include teachers, administrators, classmates and villagers who rallied together, donating money and hundreds of packages of food to the relatives of the boys and their coach. A sense of community soon began to spread, volunteers from other parts of Thailand flew in, while social media lit up with expressions of love and support. 
12. International cave divers from UK, 
USA, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia and many other countries arrived by Thursday, 28th June. Over the next few days, the divers faced a constant battle with the elements.  Two British divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton had been braving Than Luang’s narrow, murky passage ways for several days laying out guide ropes and by 2ⁿd July Monday, the lost Wild Boars and their coach had been found. The two divers spent some time trying to boost their morale. They left lights, and promised to return with food. The parents of the boys were ecstatic  
to know that their children had miraculously  survived. 
13.  After nine days, the group received 
medicated liquid food and mineral water with vitamins.

ensure water would run away from their 
faces. It was like a “shopping bag” that allowed them to manoeuvre the boys 
around the obstacles. The boys were sedated to ensure that they would not panic.
18. Rescuers had to winch the boys 
up a steep slope using a pulley system, passing the boys hand to hand. One by one, all the Wild Boars were brought out of the darkness of Tham Luang. By the time the last batch of boys and the coach were out, water levels started rising again. But there were the Navy Seal divers and a medic who had looked after the Wild Boars, as well as Richard Harris, a famed Australian cave diving expert and doctor, still in the cave. They emerged shortly and soon the flood waters rushed in.
19. It was an astonishing feat - after 
two agonizing weeks, the Thai Cave boys and their coach were finally out at last, safe and sound.
20. It’s a story of ordinary people 
coming together in a remote town with one mission: to save 12 young boys and their coach; and the impossible mission was accomplished.14. The rescuers set to work in figuring 
out how to extract 13 people – from a winding, flooded 4 km stretch of caves that even experienced divers would struggle with. 
15. Overnight a small makeshift town 
mushroomed at the rural country park by the cave entrance. Food stalls were set up and no job was too small to do. People began cleaning the toilets, offered free lifts and a local laundromat cleaned the rescuers’ clothes every night. Spirits were high but the death of a navy seal diver Saman Gunan devastated the community. 
16. Time was running out. Finally on 
6th  July, rescuers set up an oxygen supply and the boys communicated with their parents, by writing letters. On Sunday 7th July, the Thai authorities  announced they were pulling out the boys. It was a super human effort involving 100 Thai and foreign divers.
17. Each boy was given a full face air 
mask to ensure he could breathe and was clipped to a diver. Another diver accompanied  them. An  oxygen cylinder was strapped to the front of the child, while a handle was attached to their backs – and they were held face down to

I draw my sword and stare

Snows from dark skies to climb  
the T'ai-hang mountains! 
At peace I drop a hook  
into a brooklet,   
At once I'm in a boat  
but sailing sunward...
(Hard is the journey,  
Hard is the journey,  
So many turnings,  
And now where am I?)
So when a breeze breaks waves,  
bringing fair weather,  
I set a cloud for sails,  
cross the blue oceans!

Sympathy
I lay in sorrow deep depressed...
My grief a proud man heard...His looks were cold. He gave me gold.But not a kindly word.My sorrow passed – I paid him backThe gold he gave me.Then stood erect and spoke my thanksAnd blessed his charity...I lay in want, in grief and pain.A poor man passed my way.He bound my head. He gave me bread.He watched me night and day.How shall I pay him back againFor all he did to me?Oh! Gold is great. But greater far is heavenly sympathy!By Charles Mackay

Commentary on Republic Day 
Celebrations and parade at New Delhi 
Good morning Ladies and 
Gentlemen. On this splendid morning 
on behalf of the entire team of Radio India, this is Anitha Rao along with my fellow commentators Yusuf Ahmed, Manoj Pande and our Technical Audio team extending warm greetings to all the listeners on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day of India and welcome you to Rajpath New Delhi, which literally means Kingsway, the ceremonial path and one of the most important roads of India that runs through the heart of New Delhi and where the Republic Day parade takes place every year on the 26th of January.
We are placed right next to the flower 
bedecked saluting dais from where our Honourable President along with our Vice President, Prime Minister and all the other dignitaries will view the parade which showcases India’s defence capability and its cultural and social heritage. The day is memorable on account of the presence of the 10 ASEAN leaders who will be amidst us today as chief guests to honour the day when the Constitution of India came into force. My fellow commentator Yusuf is here, to share with you the proceedings of the day…
Yusuf—Good Morning and heartiest 
greetings to my fellow citizens on the joyous occasion of the 69th Republic Day of our Nation. As you all know, ASEAN is Association of South East Asian Nations comprising of 10 Nations – Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, The Philippines, Laos People’s Democratic Republic and Brunei. The whole area opposite the dais is bedecked with colourful fresh flowers and certainly the three prominent colours of yellow, saffron, white and green are given more prominence depicting the colours of our National Flag. I can see the Red Roses, Y ellow Marigold, the Bird of Paradise, the Pansies and other foliage giving the green colour to it. Over to Manoj….

www.tntextbooks.inPage 135 Communicative English Page 134 Communicative EnglishManoj − Thank you Yusuf. What 
a beautiful sight! And in a short while 
from now, the combined military band will be playing the National Anthem. There are 44 musicians drawn from 3 EME centres and ASE centres from South. They will be playing the National Anthem, the Cavalry brigade and the army star ‘ Arjunam’ .
The three chiefs of the Army, Navy 
and Air Force, the Central and State Defence Ministers have arrived. They are all stationed in the inner periphery of India Gate, flanking the ‘ Amar Jawan Jyothi’ . It’s a resplendent sight. The Amar Jawan Jyothi commemorates the indomitable courage of our soldiers and it is symbolised by a reversed rifle topped by a helmet.
The Prime Minister is now laying 
the wreath on behalf of the country at the Amar Jawan Jyothi. The Inter services guard of honour gives the command to present the arms ‘The Salami Shastra’ , followed by the reversal of the arms, “The Shok Shastra” . Six buglers stationed there sounded the last post and a two minute silence is being observed. The completion of the silence is marked by sounding the rouse by the buglers. The Prime Minister is leaving the India Gate and now over to Anitha for an eye witness account of the grand parade.
Anitha − It’s a lovely day today. 
The Prime Minister has arrived at the dais and is greeting the guests of honour on the stage. We now see the Honourable President of our country arriving ceremoniously led by the President’s body guard. The President’s body guard personnel are all handpicked, well trained horsemen, paratroopers and tank men. The Honourable President is led to hoist the National Flag.
The President is now giving the 
highest Gallantry Awards and Medals to the kin of martyrs. Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padmashree are given to eminent personalities from various fields such as literature, education, art, sports, social work, medicine, science, engineering, civil services, public affairs, trade and industry. Bravery awards to children are given for exhibiting courage and valour. Yusuf will now take over from here…
Yusuf − The customary grand parade 
has started and is moving ceremoniously, in colourful attires. The different tableaus are showcasing the country’s progress in different fields. And here comes the newly formed all Women Bikes Contingent, the 27 member BSF Women ‘Dare Devils’ Squad named ‘Seema Bhavani’ showcasing their stunts and acrobatics on their 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet Motorcycles.
After the mesmerising performance 
of the BSF women, here are the children from various schools in Delhi and 700 students across the guest countries performing on the power of Education. Manoj, isn’t it a splendid sight?
Manoj − A real feast to the eyes! A 
few of the parade’s highlights are the BSF camel band, the musical band of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the DRDO Subsonic cruise missile Tableau.

General Packet Radio Services 
known as GPRS has been around for quite some time. It was established in the early 2000s and is widely used across the world today. It is an extension of the global system for mobile communication.
GPRS works by allowing data to be 
stored into ‘packets’ . This data is then transmitted in an efficient manner across the mobile network. GPRS, however, is much faster than the cellular network system. This type of networking system can be used worldwide without difficulty. 
GPRS devices are extremely versatile. 
Any device that has GPRS capability will allow the user to have not only mobile communication but also access the internet for things such as e-mail and internet browsing. Y ou can even adjust various settings on the device in order to keep track of things like changes in temperature, sound and motion.
Car tracking devices are cheaper and 
easier to install. They mainly work via GPS satellite navigator, although in some cases a radio frequency or cellular network can be used, if GPS coverage is poor. The actual set up is really very simple; each vehicle transmits a signal to orbiting satellites which relay this information back to a specified computer. The vehicle information is then displayed on maps, allowing you to monitor speed and exact whereabouts.
By utilising real-time vehicle tracking 
you can get accurate information about the travel. Although this system enables you to avoid traffic and find the quickest road to travel, you will still find an excuse to be late!

Valli : Hello, Surya. Did you read today’s newspaper?
Surya : No, is there anything important, 
that you want me to read?
Valli : Y es, Surya. There’s an article on 
creating sarees with natural fruits, bamboo and aloe vera fibre.
Surya : Oh! That’s great! How is that 
possible? Can you give me more information?
Valli : I’ll read out the article; “Natural 
Fibre Weaving” . “The rhythm of the loom” welcomes visitors to Shanmuga Mudhaliar Street nearly 9km from Chennai Airport. There are 90 weavers in the cluster. The cluster consisting mostly of third generation weavers was formed nearly 90 years ago, along the banks of the Adyar River.
12th Communicative English Book.indb   136 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 137 Communicative English Page 136 Communicative English“In those days this cluster was 
producing real Madras chequered fabrics 
for export to Nigeria, ” says Sekar, the President of the Jute Weavers Association.
After 1970, this cluster began weaving 
cotton fabric and sarees. Kanchi Cotton dress material sets were woven in the 80’s and silk cotton during the 90’s. Over the past 10 years, the cluster has completely shifted to natural fibre weaving.
“ As a weaver, I was always looking 
for a breakthrough, something that would make handloom popular, thereby saving it from extinction, ” says Sekar, adding “ The South India Textile Research Association involved us in weaving jute and cotton blended yarn. This set me thinking of developing natural fibre yarn from other sources as well. ” At that time, a group of students approached him with banana fibre and cotton blended yarn for their project and this added a fillip to his research.
“I developed 25 types of natural 
fibres and even made it to the Limca Book of Records in 2011 for weaving a saree using 25 different fibres, ” he says.
Today the Anakaputhur Natural 
Fibre Weavers Cluster has 25 pit looms and are pioneers in many methods of natural fibre weaving. Collaborating with NIFT students in design intervention and colour combination has enhanced the reach of the products.
Sekar has introduced “MooligaiPudavai” 
(herbal Sarees) where he infuses natural fibre yarn with turmeric, tulsi, neem and sandalwood. He says, these herbs and spices have anti-bacterial properties and are good for the skin. The weavers have developed 30 different natural fibre yarns so far, of which the most popular are pineapple, aloe vera, bamboo, banana stem and erukkanchedi (Calotropis). Eager to adopt some of these practices, the North East Development council has invited Sekar to train the women weavers of Assam. 
“We have finally proved that 
handloom can be a profitable business, ” he smiles. This venture has generated more jobs, says Sekar.
Unit 5
Water Shortage
Instructor: 14 of the World's 20 big cities 
are now experiencing water scarcity 
or drought conditions. As many as 4 million people already live in regions that experience severe water stress. According to a study in the journal ‘Science Advances’ , nearly half of these people live in our country and with the rising population, this stress is going to mount.
Moderator:  I’m happy to introduce two 
eminent speakers Mr. Ramesh, retired 
Chairman of Water Management Board and Mr.Joseph, founder of ‘The Drop’ , an NGO. I now request Mr. Ramesh to throw some light on the topic and lead the discussion.
Mr.Ramesh : Humanity is facing water 
crisis. Either there is too much water in some places or there isn’t  enough water in other places and we all know that this is being driven not only by climate changes 
12th Communicative English Book.indb   137 02/02/19   5:09 PM
www.tntextbooks.inPage 139 Communicative English Page 138 Communicative Englishbut also by economic growth, population 
and poor water management. 
Moderator:  As mentioned by Mr.Ramesh,  
water management  seems to be the crucial 
point when we talk about water crisis. I now request Mr. Joseph to make a few suggestions.
Mr.Joseph : Well, to tackle water crisis, 
a good water management strategy has to be adopted at all levels of planning, developing and distributing water for maximum usage. Say for example, in the field of agriculture, water intensive crops like rice and cotton should be grown in water rich regions and crops which need less water grown in other regions where there is less supply of water.
Moderator:  Y es, Mr. Ramesh, what have 
you got to say about this?
Mr.Ramesh: To minimize water crisis, the 
main option is to share water, not only in the trans-boundary river basins but also in the river basins within nations and states.
Mr.Joseph: I would like to put forth the 
causes for this water scarcity. Shortfall of rain is the most important issue, that stems from deforestation. The absence of bunds and encroachments at the catchment areas also aggravate the water shortage issue.
Mr.Ramesh: But the good news is that 
there are always solutions to our problems. Our motto should be “The less water used, the more water saved. ” This will go a long way, towards addressing the current crisis. But for the solutions to be effective they need to be implemented vigilantly.Moderator :  Having discussed the status, 
causes and problems, let us also consider some practical solutions such as
v do not keep taps running
v only use what is needed resourcefully
v practise sustainable home living
v recycle used water
v
  create awareness of the dire 
consequences of water resource abuse 
v   get more involvement from people
By now we are aware how critical our 
global water shortage is.
Now the panellists are open for questions 
from the audience.

Hi everyone! Welcome to our guided 
tour to a wonderful hiking trail, high up a forested hillside to the Mystery Spot. Gravity and other forces go haywire at this pseudo – scientific anomaly, discovered in 1940. The site is located in Santa Cruz, California amongst the Oak and Eucalyptus trees, near Granite Creek, and within the California Redwood forest. It is a circular area of effect around 150 feet or 46 metres in diameter. Within the Mystery Spot you will be stunned as your perceptions of the laws of physics and gravity are questioned. On this gravity hill you will experience, tilt-induced visual illusion. The illusion experienced by visitors results from the oddly tilted environment as well as standing on a tilted floor. These visual illusions include balls

than normally possible without falling down.
The mystery spot was discovered in 
1939 by a group of surveyors and was opened to the public in 1940. The Mystery Spot has amazed and perplexed hundreds and thousands of visitors from all over the world.
Some speculate that cones of metal 
were secretly brought here by aliens and buried in the earth as guidance systems of their spacecraft. Some think it is in fact, the spacecraft itself buried deep within the ground. Other theories include carbon dioxide permeating from the earth, a hole in the ozone layer, a magma vortex and the highest dielectric bio cosmic radiation. Whatever the cause is, it remains a mystery.

www.tntextbooks.inPage 159 Communicative English Page 158 Communicative EnglishUseful job interview
1)  Before the interview, practice your responses to the typical questions most 
employers ask.
2) Know about the company to which you have applied for a job.
3) Be there on time for the interview. Do not be late.4) Dress smartly.5) Do not use strong perfumes when you go for the interview.
6)  Do not answer the interview questions with just a ‘Y es’ or a ‘No’ , but at the same 
time do not give very lengthy answers.
7) Stress your achievements but undermine your weaknesses.8) Do not complain about your present employer.9) Be enthusiastic in your replies.10) Be professional.
Most Asked Job Interview Questions and How to 
Answer Them
1. Tell me about yourself
Confine your answer to work related st uff. Never go much into the personal details 
unless the panel asks you.
2. Tell me about your dream job
3. Why did you leave your last job?
4. What is your weakness?If your response is a spe cific designation along with the responsibilities that you expect, 
you may be put under the scanner to co nfirm whether you suit that particular role. So 
better make use of stereotyped phrases like amicable environment etc.
Give out a positive response of the sort “I am in pursuit of greener pastures” . Just co nfine 
your words to better opportunities, However factual that may be, never ever speak out 
things like “It is the Ill tempered boss at the workplace that made me think of this change ” 
Don’t start listing out all your personality disorders straight away. Stay composed and

Water scarcity is a major threat in 
many parts of the world, including India. 
In the world, over two billion people are dying because of it. The situation would worsen in the future with increased demand for fresh water.  The earth is 70 per cent water, as are our bodies. We can last for about two to three weeks without food, but we would be dead within three days without water. What we do to our water, we do to ourselves.
Humans are increasingly putting 
this essential resource in serious danger. We poison our ground and surface water. We burn fossil fuels that cause acid rain and global warming. We dam our rivers, interrupting the water flow and destroyed delicate ecosystems downstream. We clear vegetation and pave massive land areas, decreasing the groundwater level and increasing flood and soil erosion. On top of all this, those with access to the most water are wasting vast amounts of it.
In September 2000,  the United 
Nations adopted a millennium Declaration setting out targets to be reached in the coming years. One target is to reduce by half, “the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water “ by the year 2015.
The Millennium Declaration 
also aims, “to stop the unsustainable exploitation of water resources by developing water management strategies at the regional, national and local levels,  Listening
which promote both equitable access and adequate supplied” . Our planet’s system for purification of water, like all its other systems, is delicate and balanced. It is high time that each one of us takes positive decisions to conserve water, the ‘green gold’ essential for all life on earth.
Questions:1.  __________ is the major threat in 
many parts of the world
a) Resources in danger
b) water scarcityc) flood and soil erosion d) global warming
2.  What does the burning of fossil fuel 
cause?
a) heavy rainb) floodsc) water scarcityd) acid rain
3. How is the eco system destroyed?
a)  By poisoning the ground waterb) burning fossil fuelsc) by constructing damsd) by not constructing dams

These Islands of great beauty, home 
to the finest rainforests, silver beaches, and sparkling oceans teeming with life – the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been earmarked for large – scale tourism promotion and development. The Andaman Islands have the potential to emerge as the world’s most erotic and high-end holiday destinations for eco-tourism, and for advent tourism.
Tourism creates more jobs than do 
the agriculture and industries sectors. Keeping in view the ecology and limited carrying capacity of the islands, a balances should be struck between environment and economic development through tourism.
Despite their unique natural wealth, 
the Andamans have been attracting meager tourist traffic – about 90,000 per year. Chennai and Kolkatta are the only gateways to the islands. High –spending tourists from Europe and America take four to six days to reach the destination, and non-availability of tickets between foreign destinations and India and from the mainland to Port Blair deters tourists

Andamans is not an attractive proposition.
A major problem in these islands 
is the acute water shortage. Even though 
the islands receive an average rainfall of 3000 mm every year, in the dry season, when the tourists start to come, the water problem begins. By the time the tourist season is over, and the tourists have gone, the problem becomes a nightmare. The migration of people from the mainland also continues and the administration refuses to do a anything  about this. It is a crisis that grows every passing year.

Tourism has emerged as the world’s 
largest industry. Growing rapidly in the last two decades, today it accounts for six per cent of world output and employs some 100 million people around the globe. Since the end of the Second World War, it has  developed immense revenue and development potential and stands today as a unique natural renewable resource industry.
Tourism – the travel – based 
recreation – provides people with a change of place and a break from the monotony of daily life. It brings peoples of different nations together, allowing them to come into close contact with each other’s customs and other aspects of life. It reveals the scenic beauty and past heritage of a country to people belonging to other nations. The knowledge and experience gained in the process can lead to greater understanding and tolerance, and can even foster world peace.

In the 16th century, an age of great 
marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king’s favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.
A papal decree of 1493 had assigned 
a land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than  a  year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.
One  ship deserted while in this 
passage and returned to Spain, so fewer

Later, Magellan became involved in an 
insular co nflic t in the Philippines and was 
killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward  journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no  precipice at the edge.

Marie Curie was one of the most 
accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie’s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom.
 Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, 
Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a Fresh university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.

at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest 
scientists of her day, one of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse – drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.
Curie’s feeling of desolation finally 
began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.

Passage –7
Read the passage and answer each 
question below in a short sentence.
Some people suffer from an inability 
to sleep, a disease called insomnia and it 
may be due to different factors. The first factor many be ‘biological imbalance’ . Sleep is caused by a sleep system and wakefulness is caused by an arousal system. Both the systems are governed by the brain. In order to have a good sleep, the arousal system must be less and the sleep system must be more. When the arousal system goes up due to tension, insomnia many occur. Drugs are the second factor. People who consume alcohol habitually become prey to insomnia. Drugs like stimulants, sedatives, certain thyroid drugs and heart medicines can cause sleeplessness. Both sleeping pills and alcohol appear to promise better sleep. But habits and disturbing environments are the third factor in making one lose his sleep. If the bedroom is too noisy or too cold it may make one keep awake. If the stomach has too little or too much food, it may cause sleeplessness. Physical exercise too close to bedtime also confuses the sleep mechanism.

 (Topsy) was one of  the blacks of 
her race; and her round shining eyes, 
glittering as glass beads, moved with quick   glances over everything in the room. Her mouth half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new master’s parlour, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth. Her woolly hair was braided in Sunday little tails which stuck out in every direction. The expression of the face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunningness over which was oddly drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity. She was dressed in a single, filthy, ragged garment, made of begging: and stood with her hands demurely folded before her. Although there was some thing odd and goblin – like about her appearance – something as Miss Ophelia afterwards said’ so heathenish’ , as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay.

Passage –11
In the eighteenth century, two men, 
a French Professor, Gabriel Venel, and a British chemist Joseph Priestly made a rather pleasant discover. They found that water charged with carbon – di –oxide tasted rather nice. Jacob Schweppe, a Swiss chemist began to manufacture soda water in England. This was marketed under the name Seltz. Soon, soda water became a popular refreshment.
By the beginning of the 19th century, 
many factories and bottling plants were set up in Europe and the United States to make and bottle this art ificial ‘ mineral water’ 
Later on, it was discovered that soda 
could be flavoured too. Y ou could have tasted orange flavoured or lime flavoured soda… but the most popular flavoured soda grew to be the cola. This flavor is taken from the cola tree that grows in the  tropical parts of Africa, South America and Asia.Coco-cola, which is now one of the 
most popular carbonated drinks, was first served in 1886 at a medical ship in Atlanta, Georgia, in South America. IT marked a first in the flavouring of carbonated water.

Passage –13
Food, generally speaking, decays as 
time passes. Cooked food or uncooked meat and fish or fruits lose their freshness, become old and spoil in warm, wet air by undergoing chemical changes because of bacteria, yeasts and moulds. Some spoil within hours while other take days or weeks. Salt, Sun’s heat, oil have been used to store and save food items from decomposing. Salted and dried fish is an example.
During the past five or six decades, 
several changes have taken place in our life styles. There are more towns and cities today than I the past; people are concentrated in these places. Population has grown in their land. And they also like to eat readymade foods.
All these changes have brought 
about one big change. That is, processed and canned foods an drinks have become part of our food habits. Getting food items like meat, fish, peas, fruits, and soft drinks like Cococola, Pepsi, Rasna ready for sales inside a country or in another country has become an industry. Factories prepare and produce readymade foods, using the knowledge provided by food science and Technology. They use caning, dehydration, smoke and refrigeration methods to process and preserve foods. For this purpose they se food additives to ad flavours, colour, nutrients to foods.
Food can be preserved by controlling 
or destroying the agents that spoil foods. A few of these agents are bacteria, moulds, insects, rodents, warm and wet air.
Caning is a thermal or heat 
processing where foods are subjected to temperatures that are high enough to kill most microorganisms. Foods are sterilized in airtight, heat-resistant pouches.
Dehydration of food removes water 
in the food and thus prevents bacteria from growing. IT compresses and freeze- dries food which can resume their original shape on rehydration.
Refrigeration and freezing help 
store foods along with their nutrients and flavours. Smoke treatment to food can preserve them only for a short time. Smoke contains guaiacol which has only limited capacity. It is now being used to add an appealing flavor.
Questions
1.  Cooked or uncooked food spoils by 
undergoing __________ changes
a) climatic
b) chemical
c) physical
d) biological
2.  Salt, heat & oil save food items from 
_________
a. burning

Passage 14
Mount Vesuvius, a volcano located 
between the ancient Italian cities of 
Pompeii and Herculaneum, has received much attention because of its frequent and destructive eruptions. The most famous  of these eruptions occurred in A.D 79
The volcano had been inactive for 
centuries. There was little warning of the coming eruption, although one account unearthed by archaeologists says that a hard rain and a strong wind had disturbed the celestial calm during the preceding night. Early the next morning, the volcano poured a huge river of molten rock down upon Herculaneum, completely burying the city and filling the harbor with coagulated lava.
Meanwhile, on the other side of 
the mountain, cinders, stone and ash rained down on Pompeii. Sparks for the burning ash ignited the combustible rooftops quickly. Large portions of the city were destroyed in the conflagration. Fire, however, was not the only cause of destruction. Poisonous sulfuric gases saturated the air. These heavy gases were not buoyant in the atmosphere and therefore sank toward the earth and suffocated people.  
Over the years, excavations of Pompeii 
and Herculaneum have revealed a great deal about the behavior of the volcano. By analyzing data, much as a zoologist dissects an animal specimen, scientists have concluded that the eruption changed large portions of the area’s Geography. For instance, it turned the Sarno River from its course ad raised the level of the beach along the Bay of Naples. Meteorologists studying these events have also concluded that Versuvius caused a huge tidal wave that affected the world’s climate.
In addition to making these 
investigations archaeologists have been able to study the skeletons of victims by using distilled water to wash away the volcanic ash. By strengthening the brittle bones with acrylic paint, scientists have been able to examine the skeletons and draw conclusions about the diet and habits

at both Pompeii and Herculaneum 
have yielded many examples of classical art, such as jewelry made of bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius and its tragic consequences have provided everyone with a wealth of data about the effects that volcanoes can have on the surrounding area. Today, volcanologists an locate and predict eruptions, saving lives and preventing the destruction of other cities and cultures.

Passage 15
King Louis XVI and Queen Marie 
Antoinette ruled France from 1774 to 1789, a time when the country was fighting bankruptcy. The royal couple did not let France’s insecure financial situation limit their immoderate spending, however. Even though the minister of finance repeatedly warned the king and queen against wasting money, they continued to spend great fortunes on their personal pleasure. This lavish spending greatly enraged the people of France. They felt that the royal couple bought its luxurious lifestyle at the poor people’s expense.
Marie Antoinette, the beautiful but 
exceedingly impractical queen, seemed uncaring about her subjects’ misery. While French citizens begged for lower

with extravagant works of art.  She also surrounded herself with artists , writers, and musicians, who encouraged the queen to spend money even more profusely.
While the queen’s favourite glutted 
themselves on huge feasts at the royal table many people in France were starving. The French government taxed the citizens outrageously. These high taxes paid for the entertainments the queen and her court so enjoyed. When the minister of finance tried to stop these royal spendthrifts, the queen replaced him.  The intense hatred that the people felt for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette kept building until it led to the French Revolution. During this time of struggle and violence (1789 – 1799 ), thousands of aristocrats, as well as the king and queen themselves  lost their lives at the guillotine. Perhaps if Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had reined in their extravagant spending, the events that rocked France would not have occurred.
